# Be Beyonce's Assistant for the Day
A simple adventure game engine written in Flask.

# About
When tasked with making a game to learn HTML, CSS, Flask, and Jinja templates, I drew inspiration from a fun twitter thread about being Beyonce's assistant for a day. The goal is to make decisions for Beyonce and not get fired by making the wrong one. With each decision, the game takes the user to different pages until they either win and went through all the possible decisions for Beyonce or they lose and are taken back to the beginning.
